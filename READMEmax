Who wrote it?

Max Jonas Werner <maxjonas.werner@haw-hamburg.de>

Requirements
------------

Python 2.7

Usage
-----

To simply start a game with default parameters run

$ python play.py

To play a specific number N of episodes run

$ python play -e N

To stop learning after N episodes of training run

$ python play -t N

To trace the learning process pass the -i parameter:

$ python play -i

For a more verbose output you may always pass the "-v" parameter.

For generating statistics there's the genstats.py module:

Run the agent with different epsilon values:

$ python genstats.py -o

See how the agent performs for a specific alpha value A:

$ python genstats.py -c A

Module description
------------------

tetris.py: Contains the game and Q-learning logic. The main interface to this 
           module is the play() function that gets all relevant Q-learning
           parameters passed as arguments.

play.py: This module is a simple frontend to the simulator in tetris.py.

utils.py: Contains some convenience functions for output of the game state etc.

genstats.py: Module for generating statistics.
